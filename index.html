    <p>I am a data consultant in the Bay Area, having worked with several startups over the last several years in an analytical, client-facing role.
    <br>I enjoy delivering solutions that enable the teams I work with to make well informed, data-driven decisions. I am passionate about all aspects
    <br>of the projects I work on, from building rapport with stakeholders to fully understand their needs to designing the product, assuring quality,
    <br>and implementing the solution.
